class cwtensor:
    """Factory Class for cybertensor.cwtensor

    The cwtensor class handles interactions with the substrate cwtensor chain.
    By default, the cwtensor class connects to the Space-pussy which serves as the main cybertensor network.
    
    The cwtensor class in cybertensor serves as a crucial interface for interacting with the cybertensor blockchain, 
    facilitating a range of operations essential for the decentralized machine learning network.

    This class enables neurons (network participants) to engage in activities such as registering on the network, managing
    staked weights, setting inter-neuronal weights, and participating in consensus mechanisms.

    The cybertensor network operates on a digital ledger where each neuron holds stakes (S) and learns a set
    of inter-peer weights (W). These weights, set by the neurons themselves, play a critical role in determining
    the ranking and incentive mechanisms within the network. Higher-ranked neurons, as determined by their
    contributions and trust within the network, receive more incentives.

    The cwtensor class connects to various cybertensor networks like the main ``space-pussy`` network or local test
    networks, providing a gateway to the blockchain layer of cybertensor. It leverages a staked weighted trust
    system and consensus to ensure fair and distributed incentive mechanisms, where incentives (I) are
    primarily allocated to neurons that are trusted by the majority of the network.

    Additionally, cybertensor introduces a speculation-based reward mechanism in the form of bonds (B), allowing
    neurons to accumulate bonds in other neurons, speculating on their future value. This mechanism aligns
    with market-based speculation, incentivizing neurons to make judicious decisions in their inter-neuronal
    investments.

    Args:
        network (str): The name of the cybertensor network (e.g., 'bostrom', 'space-pussy', 'local') the instance is
            connected to, determining the blockchain interaction context.
        chain_endpoint (str): The blockchain node endpoint URL, enabling direct communication with the cybertensor
            blockchain for transaction processing and data retrieval.

    Example Usage::

        # Connect to the main cybertensor network (bostrom).
        main_cwtensor = cwtensor(network='bostrom')

        # Register a new neuron on the network.
        wallet = cybertensor.Wallet(...)  # Assuming a wallet instance is created.
        success = main_cwtensor.register(wallet=wallet, netuid=netuid)

        # Set inter-neuronal weights for collaborative learning.
        success = main_cwtensor.set_weights(wallet=wallet, netuid=netuid, uids=[...], weights=[...])

        # Speculate by accumulating bonds in other promising neurons.
        success = main_cwtensor.delegate(wallet=wallet, delegate=other_neuron, amount=bond_amount)

        # Get the metagraph for a specific subnet using given cwtensor connection
        metagraph = cwtensor.metagraph(netuid=netuid)

    By facilitating these operations, the cwtensor class is instrumental in maintaining the decentralized
    intelligence and dynamic learning environment of the cybertensor network.
